A stove, is a stove
No matter where you go
A patty is a patty
That's what I say
A grill is a grill
This is surely so
And fries should be fries
Either way
But this grill is not a home
This is not the stove I know
I would trade it all away
If you'd come back to stay
This kitchen's not the same
Without you
It's just a greasy spoon
Just a greasy spoon
Without you
