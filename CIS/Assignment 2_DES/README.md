The DES program is currently set up only for binary user input
Input your master/secret key and plaintext as instructed
Plaintext should be 64 bits or less in length
Improper inputs will shut down the program

The program runs key generation, encryption, and decryption
The program will print all sub keys, the inputted plain text
the DES encrypted cipher text, and the DES decrypted text

Please give me notes on the code, this is only my second time touching classes
