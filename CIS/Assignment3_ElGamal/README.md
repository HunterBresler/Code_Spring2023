This runs with a driver function and dev mode where you send a key size + a binary number. 
I don't have time to explain what the number is, but it helps calculate safe primes
Just follow the instructions in the MAIN file.

All keys and texts are stored in files to represent them being sent or stored outside the program.

Not sure whether or not my key generation is slow or really slow, especially since I hard coded it.
If you could tell me whether or not it's slow, that would help for the final project

The encrypt and decrypt work perfectly as far as I can tell

Also, I kinda just guessed k for miller rabin should be ceil(sqrt(# of bits))
Is that about right?

Everything is in a single class, which will probably change, but not now
